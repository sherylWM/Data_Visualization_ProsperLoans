# Project 4 - Data Visualization of Prosper Loans Dataset

This is the fourth (last) project of the Udacity Data Analytics Nano degree.

## Goal: 
Use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore Prosper Loans dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships.

### Dataset:
I used the ProsperLoans dataset that contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
